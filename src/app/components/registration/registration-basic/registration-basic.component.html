                  <p>You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not
                    for use by anyone under the age of 16.</p>

                    you
                    will only have one One Page Spotlight account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not
                    already
                    restricted by One Page Spotlight from using the Services. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if
                    law
                    requires that you must be older in order for One Page Spotlight to lawfully provide the Services to you
                    without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.</p>

                  <p>We can each end this Contract anytime we want. Both you and One Page Spotlight may terminate this
                    Contract
                    at any time with notice to the other. On termination, you lose the right to access or use the Services.
                    The
                    following shall survive termination:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Our rights to use and disclose your feedback;</li>
                    <li>Members and/or Visitors’ rights to further re-share content and information you shared through the

                    <li>Any amounts owed by either party prior to termination remain owed after termination. You can visit

                  </ul>
                  <div class="tc_h5">6. Dispute Resolution</div>
                  <p>In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, we both agree that all of these claims can only be
                    litigated in the courts in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, and we each agree to personal jurisdiction in
                    those
                    courts.</p>
                  <div class="tc_h5">7. General Terms</div>
                  <p>Here are some important details about how to read the Contract.</p>
                  <p>If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it not enforceable, you and us agree that
                    the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the
                    court cannot do that, you and us agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still
                    enforce
                    the rest of this Contract. To the extent allowed by law, the English language version of this Contract is
                    binding and other translations are for convenience only. This Contract (including additional terms that
                    may
                    be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us
                    regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.</p>
                  <p>If we don&#39;t act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that One Page Spotlight has
                    waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your
                    membership
                    or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that One Page Spotlight may assign
                    this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third party
                    beneficiaries to this Contract. We reserve the right to change the terms of this Contract and will
                    provide
                    you notice if we do and we agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you don&#39;t agree to these
                    changes, you must stop using the Services.</p>
                  <p>You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.
